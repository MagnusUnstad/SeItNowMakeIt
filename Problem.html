      <h1>The Problem</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Everything technological that is too time consuming is a problem from a technological
        perspective. Especially if we could get the work done in minutes. Let’s look at these kinds of
        problems. But first, let us ask you some questions. Are you aware of all the services that are
        connected to your email address? Have you always had the same email address ever since you
        created one? You would probably answer “no” to at least one of the questions above. Then you
        would probably have experienced problems with unwanted emails or problems with changing
        to new email address without knowing the important services that has your old email address.
        Let's look at what people say about this.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Our research</h2>
      <br>
      <p>We made a survey consisting of six questions. The survey was conducted in november 2016
        among 100 email users from different age groups all around the world. The users were
        informed about that this survey is only being used to this final project. We will use the results of
        the survey to show the importance of the problems we will address soon. The results:</p>
      <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="1.png" alt="A graph showing how old the subjects are.">
      <br>
      <p>Here we can see that 6% of the users were from age 12-18, 38% of user were from age 19-40,
        39% of the users were from age 41-55 and 6% from age 56+.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="2.png" alt="How many e-mails have you had?">
      <br>
      <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people didn't have the same email address ever since
        they created one.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="3.png" alt="Are you aware of all the services that are connected to your email address">
      <p>This diagram shows that over 90% of the people aren't aware of all the services connected to
        their email address.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="4.png" alt="Do you think it is a big problem that your e-mail is registerd places you don't remember">
      <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the people think that their unawareness of the places
        their email is registered to is a big problem</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="6.png" alt="How do you handle unwanted emails/spam">
      <p>This diagram shows how our users handle unwanted emails. The majority of the users delete it,
        ignore it or try to unsubscribe from the sender.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
      <img id="StatImg" src="5.png" alt="Would you use an application that gives you:">
      <p>This diagram shows that over 70% of the users would have used the application we will be
        describing as our solution for the problems we will be adressing now</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The First Problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The first problem: Unwanted emails. How do you handle unwanted emails? You can try to
        manually go and unsubscribe from every sender of the unwanted emails, delete every time you
        get an unwanted email, ignore every time you get an unwanted email, set up filters or report
        the unwanted email as spam. Let’s look at how our email users handle this problem.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The Second Problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The first time you created an email address, you probably wouldn’t have thought of using it for
        professional inquiries. So, your first email address would have been something like
        sexyboy97@live.no, barbie23@gmail.com, kittygirl@yahoo.com or kingofoslo@hotmail.com.
        And now you want your email address to be more professional. So, you create a new email
        address. Or you just have another good reason to change your email address, so you create a
        new one. Here you can see how many of our email users that have changed their email
        addresses. Which is over 90% as said earlier.</p>
